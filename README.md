# Auto-Github-GUI-v2
Automating the process of following, staring and forking a specific user/repo to make that github profile more fancy :)

There is another repo for autogithub on my repo which helps the user to auto push and commit their changes everyday to make their profile look more colorful :D Link here: https://github.com/nguyenph88/AutoGithub

Auto Github GUI
=======
This tool will automate the process of registering new user, then follow a specific user, star/fork a list of repos (that are of that user only).

Update: instead of generating new user over and over again, the tool will now read a list of pre-generated users and then use them to automate all the task.

Note
======
I make this tool just for fun and to sharpen my skill on how to use xpath on selenium, it is not meant to abuse the Github Service or anything related. I'm not responsible for what you will do with this tool and/or your account when it's banned. Use at your own risk! :)
